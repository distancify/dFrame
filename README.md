## Set initial navigation page

When a visitor navigates to a subpage and opens the navigation drawer, it makes sense to
show the level in the navigation that aligns with the visitor's current page. In order to
do this, simply set the class ``_dFrame-navCurrent`` to the current ``li._dFrame-navLink``.
